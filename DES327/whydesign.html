                            To me, design is a way to communicate with others with not just words.
                            I have always been curious about how human beings think and feel.
                            Through human senses, each individual has their very own feeling and
                            experience that no other has. You would probably wonder why I did not 
                            choose humanities or psychology or other majors that related to human  
                            behavior,but design. I have always been interested in creating pretty  
                            things ever since I was a kid. As I create stuff, I often ask myself  
                            how the stuff that I created touch other people. I also wonder what  
                            they would think and feel as they look at my designed stuff like drawings,  
                            paintings, cards, little decorations stuff, and recently, digital designs.  
                            So, design to me is a direct way to learn, observe, and have a sense of  
                            how people would react, think, and feel when they see or touch something.  
                            Design is like a complicated language that I want to learn in order to  
                            communicate efficiently with the public.

                            I love to help people, especially the most vulnerable ones such as children 
                            and older adults. As the social network keeps growing bigger and faster, 
                            especially during the pandemic that moved many things to online, older adults
                            need to adjust and learn to use technologies as well. I see my uncle who is 
                            in his 80s, my mom, my aunts, are struggling when it comes to smartphones 
                            and other technologies. For sure it is not easy for them to adopt these new 
                            techs which they usually complain to me that technologies are so complicated 
                            for them. Therefore, I want to help them with my UI/UX design skills that I 
                            am learning to help them have a better understanding of technologies and I 
                            also want them to feel more comfortable when using apps. That is why I want 
                            to be a good UI/UX designer; to help my mom, aunts, uncle, and other people 
                            like them have better experiences when using apps.
